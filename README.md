Ti-Mo Phase Diagram Symmetry Analysis SuiteThis repository contains a suite of C programs designed to analyze the crystal symmetry of Titanium-Molybdenum (Ti-Mo) alloys. These tools calculate the number of invariant symmetry operations for user-defined atomic clusters.This software was developed for the research paper:"Calculation of the Ti–Mo phase diagram using density functional theory and crystal symmetry"Theoretical BackgroundThe outputs of these programs directly correspond to the variables required for Equation (15) and Equation (17) in the referenced paper. Symmetry of Cluster A ($|\mathcal{N}_{A}(G)|$):The program outputs "Total valid operations," which corresponds to $|\mathcal{N}_{A}(G)|$. This value is used to calculate the multiplicity $\mu_A$ of the cluster (Eq. 15):$\mu_{A}$ = \frac{|\Gamma_{\phi}|}{|\mathcal{N}_{A}(G)|)$(Where $|\Gamma_{\phi}|$ is NUM_OPE, i.e., 24 or 48 depending on the phase).Intersection Group ($|\mathcal{N}_{A}(G) \cap \mathcal{N}_{A'}(G)|$):The "Re-check" function counts the number of operations that remain valid when the rotation center is shifted to a subcluster $A'$. This count corresponds to the order of the intersection group $|\mathcal{N}_{A}(G) \cap \mathcal{N}_{A'}(G)|$. This is used to calculate the number of subclusters $M(A', A)$ (Eq. 17):$$M(A', A) = \sum \frac{|\mathcal{N}_{A}(G)|}{|\mathcal{N}_{A}(G) \cap \mathcal{N}_{A'}(G)|}$$Included ToolsAll tools use a consistent floating-point tolerance (EPS 1e-2).M_bcc_output.c (BCC Phase): 48 Symmetry Operations ($O_h$), 9 Reference Atoms.M_hcp_output.c (HCP Phase): 24 Symmetry Operations ($D_{6h}$), 18 Reference Atoms.M_w_output.c (Omega Phase): 24 Symmetry Operations, 22 Reference Atoms.UsageCompilationUse gcc (or any standard C compiler) and link the math library (-lm).gcc -o calc_bcc M_bcc_output.c -lm
gcc -o calc_hcp M_hcp_output.c -lm
gcc -o calc_w   M_w_output.c   -lm
Execution & Output InterpretationRun the executable (e.g., ./calc_hcp) and follow the prompts.Main Output:Input: Atoms defining cluster $A$.Output: Total valid operations: X $\rightarrow$ This is $|\mathcal{N}_{A}(G)|$.Re-check Output:Input: Atoms defining subcluster $A'$.Output: Valid operations: X / YX is the total valid operations for $A$ ($|\mathcal{N}_{A}(G)|$).Y (local valid) is the number of operations valid for $A$ around the center of $A'$ ($|\mathcal{N}_{A}(G) \cap \mathcal{N}_{A'}(G)|$).ConfigurationConstants such as A_X, A_Y, A_Z (lattice constants) and original_position (atomic coordinates) are hardcoded for the Ti-Mo supercells used in the study.
